## Welcome to My Data Science Journey!   

Hi there!  I'm a software engineer with a growing passion for data analysis and data science. This repository serves as my playground to explore this exciting field, where I'll be storing various projects I create along the way.  

This README file provides a quick overview of what you'll find here. âœ¨

**Getting Started (Software Engineer Hat On)**

*This repository follows standard Git practices.*

* **Branches:** Feature branches will be used for development, and master will always reflect a stable state.
* **Commit Messages:** Clear and descriptive commit messages are encouraged (using the conventional commit style is a plus!).
* **Pull Requests:** Feel free to submit pull requests for any contributions or suggestions.


**Projects (Data Enthusiast Hat On)**

This repository will house a variety of projects encompassing:

* Data wrangling and cleaning  
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Data visualization
* Machine learning (fingers crossed!)

The specific projects will showcase my learning process as I delve deeper into the world of data science.  

**Stay Tuned!**

I'm constantly learning and evolving, so expect new projects to be added regularly. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate! 

**P.S.**  I'm always open to feedback and suggestions.  Let me know what you think!
